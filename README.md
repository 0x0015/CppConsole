<h1>CppConsole: an interactive console for c++</h1>
<br><br>
Note:  this is know to be a stupid idea.  (Breaking news: see "cling" [here](https://github.com/root-project/cling) for something that actually is decent)<br><br>

For anyone who would ever want to use this, it compiles the code, and runs it on the spot, and for that reason doesnt keep all the data(such as variables) you might expect.<br>
You must have g++ installed, and set as an enviroment variable(like PATH).<br>
<br><br>
At least it has compiled speeds...
